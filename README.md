# ImageCaptioning
Image Captioning Model generates a caption according to the uploaded image.
Model was developed using various Neural Networks such as LSTMs,CNN and Multilayer Perceptrons.
Features were extracted from images using transfer learning with ResNet50 model.
Captions were processed using NLTK and various other techniques.
